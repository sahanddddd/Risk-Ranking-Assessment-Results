This R code is designed to process, analyze, and visualize the results of an ACDC Risk Ranking Survey. The code reads survey data from an Excel file, processes it, calculates mean values and standard deviations for different criteria, and generates plots to visualize the results. The purpose of the risk ranking survey is to assess the risk associated with various diseases based on factors such as risk trajectory, epidemic potential, disease severity, and preparedness.

The code can be broken down into the following sections:

- Loading necessary libraries: The code begins by loading the required R libraries, such as dplyr, ggplot2, and tidyverse, which are essential for data manipulation, visualization, and other related tasks.

- Reading and preprocessing the data: The code reads the survey data from an Excel file and selects relevant columns to be used in the analysis. It then reshapes the data into a long format for easier processing.

- Aggregating survey values: The code calculates mean values for various criteria (A. Risk trajectory, B. Epidemic potential, C. Disease severity, and D. Preparedness and countermeasures) per disease per participant. The results are stored in a new data frame.

- Summarizing results: The code computes mean and standard deviation values for each group type (A, B, C, and D) across all survey participants. It also calculates the average value of A and B and their combined standard deviation.

- Plotting the results: The code generates two plots using ggplot2 - one with error bars and one without. These plots display the relationships between outbreak impact (C), risk trajectory and epidemic potential (A and B), and preparedness (D).



<b>Potential Applications:</b>

- Prioritizing resources: Risk ranking allows public health authorities to prioritize resources and interventions for diseases with higher risk and impact.

- Identifying vulnerable areas: Risk ranking can highlight areas where preparedness and countermeasures are lacking, enabling targeted improvements in those areas.

- Informing policy decisions: Risk ranking provides policymakers with valuable information for making informed decisions about public health interventions and resource allocation.

- Evaluating the effectiveness of existing interventions: By comparing risk rankings before and after the implementation of interventions, it is possible to assess their effectiveness.

- Guiding research and development: Risk ranking can help identify areas where more research is needed to better understand the risk factors and potential interventions for specific diseases.

- Enhancing public awareness: Communicating risk ranking results to the public can raise awareness of the importance of preventive measures and encourage compliance with public health guidelines.
